## Introduction

It is clear that the main value proposition of Qubic is the bet on being a key relevant player in the AGI space, and this has been the aim since the beginning when CFB started the project, with the goal of developing it by April 13th 2027.

It is also clear that 2026 will be decisive to improve the chances of reaching that goal.

When Dr. José Sanchez & David Vivancos started as Science Advisors by mid 2024, the task was to document and provide neuro scientific and AI evidence that the path Qubic was following was indeed aligned with a bioinspired approach and grounded in technical feasibility, as long as this can be, since there is no previous path to reach AGI (True AI), and it is a field to be built.

Over 2024 & 2025 besides providing guidance, and presenting Qubic Science in international research venues, two key papers have been developed.

**December 2024:**

- *Qubic AGI Journey Human and Artificial Intelligence: Toward an AGI with Aigarth*
 <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387364505_Qubic_AGI_Journey_Human_and_Artificial_Intelligence_Toward_an_AGI_with_Aigarth>  
  Outlining CFB’s Qubic AGI vision and it’s biological plausibility

**November 2025**

- *Neuraxon: A New Neural Growth & Computation Blueprint*  
<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/397331336_Neuraxon>  
  Developing a fundamental open framework to build Aigarth vision.

Now is the time to go deeper, and this is the aim of this scientific proposal for the first trimester of 2026.

## 🚀 Proposition

Over the past 18 months, we have served as Advisors within Ecosystem, with a limited time and budget commitment, to audit and validate the ideas proposed by CfB regarding a decentralized general artificial intelligence within Qubic.

Following the completion of Ecosystem, given the current state of AI amid large and dangerous technological monopolies and the positive tests of our new Neuraxon model as the foundation of a potential AGI, we propose that the scientific group (Sanchez & Vivancos) continues independently and expands its scope, commitment, and purpose by increasing its dedication to Qubic from being Science Advisors of Qubic to being Principal Research Scientist, part time (half/day) since this is the way to improve the chances of success.

The work will be to follow the outlined path from the original Qubic Aigarth 2024 paper, and “simply” build the science that will support it, with the Neuraxon paper we paved the ground for what would be the basics of a True ai. 

The work done in November & December 2025 already demonstrated it, by using the artificial life simulation, showing that the proposed architecture was indeed plausible. 

But now the next steps are to evolve it so it can really spark the light of “real intelligence”, not only in a figurative way, but with testable open source code grounded in neuroscience.

To explain it in simple terms over the previous 70 years most of the AI developments that fuel the current generative AI revolution were based on a single simple neural architecture, the perceptron, minimally evolved since then.

With Neuraxon we have challenged and updated that view, creating something that is really “alive” in the sense that there is no difference between training and inference or the execution and also by including all the advances of Neuroscience, AI & AGI up to late 2025.

Second, what we will do over the following 3 months of 2026 is to get this to the next level, by implementing and researching how these Neuraxons can follow evolutionary paths, be integrated with more complex architectures and show usefulness in problem solving. 

The outputs will be a new paper, weekly updated code in GitHub, monthly new data sets on Hugging face to share the exploratory paths, new periodically demos for the community to learn and play and be part of the new science that is being created, and lastly biweekly AMAs to share progress.

We propose this to be fully 100% open science because we think it is the best way to put Qubic in the front line of research and media spotlight, and because openness has been at the heart of Qubic since the beginning.

CfB´s Aigarth team will run in parallel and their outputs once published will be integrated or hybridized again with Neuraxon so they work in unity. The same thing that already happened with the Neuraxon paper, the main difference is that all our work is going to be open science and that will build trust for Qubic in the science community and also in the development circles, of course the hybridized parts with the openly released Aigarth parts will follow their original license requirements, while keeping fully open source the unique parts.

After completing these steps, Neuraxon can be tested and hybridized in Qiner using some Testnet nodes. A developer proposal may be necessary for that future integration.
